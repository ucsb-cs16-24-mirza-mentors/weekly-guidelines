# Week 2: 
## Thank you!
* Zhiyu for setting up la02
* Keith for fixing the submission guidelines
* Andrew, Jack, Keith, JinJin for test driving lab02
* JinJin for creating pair partners (I re-did it for a few reasons, but thanks!)

Everyone - please show up for the 190J plenary sessions - we need your energy and there will be fun educative games!


## Logistics
* Resolve any issues related to pair partners and getting added to tools for the course, github signup, gradescope (lead TA for each section): [Mentor group, pair partner source file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spKFctm0rupYa4ERyz-SDiiojCinGsyvRkopnurJ8pM/edit?usp=sharing)
* Open labs are in session:[https://ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/info/cs24_open_lab_hours/](https://ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/info/cs24_open_lab_hours/)
Planning keys. Students should be added to github via our signup tool and not invited directly.
* Reach out to your mentor groups with a welcome message:
[https://ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/](https://ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/)
* Update mentor profiles - Tutor volunteer?: [https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s18/ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/blob/master/_info/staff.md](https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s18/ucsb-cs24-s18.github.io/blob/master/_info/staff.md)

## Upcoming assignments
* pa01 (Zhiyu) - ready? Tests, solutions, starter code. What are the goals? What are some things to look out for
* lab03 (JinJin) - suggestions for updates from last quarter, gradescope setup (due Thursday)
* homework grading h01 - Yufi, JinJin - we need the final exam graded for correctness but points should be awarded based on attempt. Jinjin - release the grades, regrade requests accepted fro three days after release. Communicate that to students and then upload all the grades to gauchospace after regrades are closed.
* Update h03  (correct confusing parts from last quarter) - Jack (due Thursday)
* Recommended changes for lab04 (Jack) (due Thursday)
* For help with gradescope - see template assignments on github. Diba will go over this briefly towards the end of the meeting. 

## Goals for mentor groups
* Look up the reported confidence of your mentees (Google sheet shared on slack). 
* Talk to your mentees about topics they found difficult in h01 (CS16 final exam). Set up a time during open labs to review these topics. Specifically refer students to the CS16 labs on recursion and linked lists if they have not done those labs already:
     * [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab06/)
     * [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab07/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/lab/lab07/)

* For pa01: we commend that students design their own statistician class based on the problem description in the book. Discuss their design choices compared to the class definition in the starter code with mentor. Should be done in person. Then implement the class based on the provided skeleton code.

* Other suggestions?

# Week 1 : Review TA and tutor duties, work assignments

## Releasing labs and programming assignments (due Thursday before each lab or pa)
One TA is responsible for releasing each of the pa/lab assignments. This means ensuring that the following are done at least three days before the lab is due to go out
* there are no typos on the writeup
* the starter code is upto date and does not contain stale information, 
* the assignment is setup on gradescope and there is a corresponding repo on github (refer to lab00 and lab01)
* the assignment is marked as true on the course website.
* a sample solution is available on github (refer to lab00)
* Create an excel sheet that the others can use to enter feedback on student code and give points on style etc [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gV7Hjcf7aWFDTX6oYWRdBXrIKSyR-Pj1?usp=sharing)

Lab release assignments:

- lab2: Zhiyu
- lab3: JinJin
- lab4: Jack
- lab5: Zhiyu
- lab6: Jack
- lab7: 


- pa01 - Zhiyu
- pa02  Jin Jin
- pa03 (checkpoint and actual assignment) Jack

## Preparing for the labs: (due Monday before each lab or pa)
Everyone MUST read and do the labs for the upcoming week prior to Tuesday. Make a submission on gradescope to indicate that you have finished preparing. You may use your own past solution. Report any errors on the labs to the TA in charge for that lab

## In labs (lead TA/tutor)
* Briefly go over what the lab is about and provide any useful pointers based on your experience with completing the labs. 
* Remind students of the open lab times available that week where they can come to get help. We need to do this until there is a steady flow in the open labs. 
* Distribute the homeworks and collect them at the end of the lab
* Take attendance for that lab. - figure this out
* Work with the tutors to ensure that the lab is running smoothly. 
* Make announcements about common problems students are facing and periodically
* The 6pm lead TA (Zhiyu) should hand over all the homeworks to our grader Yifu (yifu@umail.ucsb.edu)

## In labs (everyone)

* In the first lab section, the 190J tutors should just shadow the other tutors and observe silently
* In subsequent labs, please check in with your group of mentees often. Don't just stay in one place or talk to a small group. Make the rounds and look available.
* Arrive ontime to both your section labs and open labs, if you cannot make to one of the labs due to an emergency find someone who can cover for you.
* Make contact with the students early on and learn their names


## TA grading responsibilities

* HWs - all TAs are expected to help with HW grading. First four homeworks - Zhiyu, next four homeworks Jin Jin. TA in charge should create the rubric in gradescope (mainly need to copy these over from last quarter) BEFORE the homework is due. Grading should be done in a week and uploaded to gauchospace by the TA in charge of that homework

* Exams - all TAs and paid tutors must be available to help with exam grading (midterms and final exams). You may not take off early in the finals week. 

- Midterm 1 grading will be on Thursday (04/26) (2p - 5p)
- Midterm 2 grading will be on Thursday (05/17) (2p - 5p)
- Final exam grading will be Thursday of finals week 06/14 (10am -3pm) - don't take off

## Feedback on student code due Fridays 
* You must track the progress of your mentees on github on a weekly basis and provide informal feedback in labs
* Provide written feedback on student work (via the feedback excel sheets) almost every other Friday. For programming assignments where students are expected to desigb their own classes (pa02, pa03) and some of the labs, review their design before they implement it.
* Deadlines for written feedback

 - Fri 04/27 5pm - pa02, lab03
 - Fri 05/04 5pm - feedback on progress on pa02 
 - Fri 05/18 5pm - feedback and style points on pa02
 - Fri 06/01 5pm - feedback on class design and progress on pa03 (you should be in close communication with your mentees to get this done before the deadline, right after they have code ready for review)
 

## TO DO's related to logistic

1. TA to create a list of pair programming partners and mentor groups using the lab00 student responses, publish on the course website using a template similar to [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/) : Jin Jin

2. TA to add all the staff to our class org on github - zhiyu
3. 
4. Reader to print homeworks and bring them to the first section on Tuesdays, collect scan and upload homeworks to gradescope on a weekly basis.
5. Need a TA in charge of uploading grades to gauchospace on a regular basis: ta in charge of the lab
6. Finalize open lab schedule and publish to website [http://bit.ly/2GtodZM](http://bit.ly/2GtodZM) starting next week: Jack

## TO DO's related to content 

1. TA to setup labs 2 and 3, 5, on gradescope, tutor to update the write for these labs: 
2. Lab04 needs to be reworked to include the implementation of all of the BST operations - successor, predecessor, delete, and also be made generic with templates. Need to set up the tests on gradescope
3. Pa03 should be updated to include more guidance and a checkpoint

# Week 4 (CS24)

Tasks for this week are due 02/14 (wed) midnight. For each of your mentees, fill in their umail in [the feedback status Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l-I6d2npbjtzkmI9l5imzuk0osymD5XqC-WJmk8DCA4/edit?usp=sharing) and mark X in column N when your feedback is ready 

This week you will provide feedback on pa01 and lab03 in student feedback repos

You will also summarize the overall performance of your mentees based on observations in lab sections, CS16- final exam, homeworks, github usage and pair programming



## Step 1: Create individual/pair feedback repos

* Follow this guide to create the feedback repos:
[Creating feedback repos](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-24-mirza-mentors/weekly-guidelines/blob/master/create_feedback_repo.md)
* Make sure all the feedback goes in a single file called feedback.md with clearly labeled sections - See formatting instructions in the above link

* Your feedback.md file should have the following structure - you can just copy and paste below:

```
# Feedback for Selena Gomez and Justin Timberlake, CS24 W18

* Mentor: Lily Gaucho

* Feedback on your labs will be encoded using the following legend:

* \+ o - are indications from Moderator's review
  * o is **ok**, met expectations (no deductions),
  * \- **below expectations** (deduction might be made by TA or instructor), 
  * \+ means **exceeds expectations** 
   * In rare cases, instructor or TA might award points to offset other deductions. No guarantee of this.
  * ? is a flag used by moderators to raise a **question** for the TA to investigate further
* Poss: Possible Points
* Pts: Points Awarded (only filled in by TA or Instructor, NOT by moderator)

# pa01 feedback: code review of repo on github

# lab03 feedback: code review of repo on github

# mid quarter report
```

## Step 2: Clone the student repo for the labs from github

For each individual/student pair, clone their repo for pa01 and lab03 to your local machine or csil 


## Step 3: pa01 feedback: code review of repo on github

In the student feedback repo on github, under the section for pa01 paste the following feedback template which includes a table 

```
## pa01 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions implemented|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| CON  |       | Correct implementation of constructor  |
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |

```

You must try to compile student code and look at it in an editor to give feedback on all these items. 

If student code is not available on github, email them to upload it and mention that in the future there will be point deductions. 

## Step 4: lab03 feedback: code review of repo on github

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo

```
## lab03 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions of IntList were implemented|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| BIG  |       | Demonstrates an understanding ofthe c'tor, copy c'tor, copy assignment  |
| LEAK |       | Code has no memory leaks|
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |


* For STY: code is readable, well indented, good choice of variable names

```

Include any other general feedback or comments


## Step 5: Mid quarter report

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo. Identify areas that are going well and areas that need improvement, offer suggestions

```
## Feedback on overall performance

Your attendence and engagement in lab sections (has been great)/(needs improvement)/(absent).
I think you and your partner are (working great)/(need help with pair programming)/(are having much trouble communicating)
(Great job pushing your code to github)/(Please push your code to github regularly to receive feedback and credit)
Your performance on the final as been (great)/(satisfactory)/(low). (I am happy to help with clarifying any concepts). I have identified the following areas that you will need to work on:

1.
2.
3.

```
