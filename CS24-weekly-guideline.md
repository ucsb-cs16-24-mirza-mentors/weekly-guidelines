# Week 1 

* Review TA and tutor duties

1. Everyone MUST read the labs for the upcoming week prior to Tuesday. You must actually do the lab and make a submission to gradescope. Okay to use your own past solutions. Report any errors on the labs to the TA in charge for that lab

* TA lab release assignments
- lab2:
- lab3:
- lab4:
- lab5:
- lab6:
- lab7:
- lab8:

* TA grading responsibilities



* TO DO's related to logistics
1. TA to create a list of pair programming partners and mentor groups using the lab00 student responses, publish on the course website using a template similar to [https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/](https://ucsb-cs16-w18.github.io/info/mentor_groups/)

2. TA to add all the staff to our class org on github
3. Finalize times for exam grading (midterm 1, 2 and final exam)
4. Reader to print homeworks and bring them to the first section on Tuesdays, collect scan and upload homeworks to gradescope on a weekly basis.

* TO DO's related to content 

1. Need a TA to setup labs 2 and 3, 5, on gradescope, tutor to update the write for these labs
2. Lab04 needs to be reworked to include the implementation of all of the BST operations - successor, predecessor, delete, and also be made generic with templates. Need to set up the tests on gradescope
3. Pa03 should be updated to include more guidance and a checkpoint
4. TA to create new lab 06 on priority queues (together with Diba)





# Week 4 (CS24)

Tasks for this week are due 02/14 (wed) midnight. For each of your mentees, fill in their umail in [the feedback status Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l-I6d2npbjtzkmI9l5imzuk0osymD5XqC-WJmk8DCA4/edit?usp=sharing) and mark X in column N when your feedback is ready 

This week you will provide feedback on pa01 and lab03 in student feedback repos

You will also summarize the overall performance of your mentees based on observations in lab sections, CS16- final exam, homeworks, github usage and pair programming



## Step 1: Create individual/pair feedback repos

* Follow this guide to create the feedback repos:
[Creating feedback repos](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-24-mirza-mentors/weekly-guidelines/blob/master/create_feedback_repo.md)
* Make sure all the feedback goes in a single file called feedback.md with clearly labeled sections - See formatting instructions in the above link

* Your feedback.md file should have the following structure - you can just copy and paste below:

```
# Feedback for Selena Gomez and Justin Timberlake, CS24 W18

* Mentor: Lily Gaucho

* Feedback on your labs will be encoded using the following legend:

* \+ o - are indications from Moderator's review
  * o is **ok**, met expectations (no deductions),
  * \- **below expectations** (deduction might be made by TA or instructor), 
  * \+ means **exceeds expectations** 
   * In rare cases, instructor or TA might award points to offset other deductions. No guarantee of this.
  * ? is a flag used by moderators to raise a **question** for the TA to investigate further
* Poss: Possible Points
* Pts: Points Awarded (only filled in by TA or Instructor, NOT by moderator)

# pa01 feedback: code review of repo on github

# lab03 feedback: code review of repo on github

# mid quarter report
```

## Step 2: Clone the student repo for the labs from github

For each individual/student pair, clone their repo for pa01 and lab03 to your local machine or csil 


## Step 3: pa01 feedback: code review of repo on github

In the student feedback repo on github, under the section for pa01 paste the following feedback template which includes a table 

```
## pa01 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions implemented|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| CON  |       | Correct implementation of constructor  |
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |

```

You must try to compile student code and look at it in an editor to give feedback on all these items. 

If student code is not available on github, email them to upload it and mention that in the future there will be point deductions. 

## Step 4: lab03 feedback: code review of repo on github

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo

```
## lab03 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions of IntList were implemented|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| BIG  |       | Demonstrates an understanding ofthe c'tor, copy c'tor, copy assignment  |
| LEAK |       | Code has no memory leaks|
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |


* For STY: code is readable, well indented, good choice of variable names

```

Include any other general feedback or comments


## Step 5: Mid quarter report

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo. Identify areas that are going well and areas that need improvement, offer suggestions

```
## Feedback on overall performance

Your attendence and engagement in lab sections (has been great)/(needs improvement)/(absent).
I think you and your partner are (working great)/(need help with pair programming)/(are having much trouble communicating)
(Great job pushing your code to github)/(Please push your code to github regularly to receive feedback and credit)
Your performance on the final as been (great)/(satisfactory)/(low). (I am happy to help with clarifying any concepts). I have identified the following areas that you will need to work on:

1.
2.
3.

```
