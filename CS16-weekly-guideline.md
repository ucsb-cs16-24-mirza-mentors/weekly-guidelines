# Week 4 (CS16)

Tasks for this week are due 02/14 (wed) midnight. For each of your mentees, fill in their umail in [the feedback status Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTU5OFqzwy01dJWWCWarybeEz_14RNIkKSrbKc0AyxQ/edit?usp=sharing) and mark X in column F when your feedback is ready 

This week you will provide feedback on lab01 and lab02 in student feedback repos

You will also summarize the overall performance of your mentees based on observations in lab sections, performance on quiz 1-3, github usage and pair programming


## Step 1: Create individual/pair feedback repos

* Follow this guide to create the feedback repos:
[Creating feedback repos](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-24-mirza-mentors/weekly-guidelines/blob/master/create_feedback_repo.md)
* Make sure all the feedback goes in a single file called feedback.md with clearly labeled sections - See formatting instructions in the above link

* Your feedback.md file should have the following structure - you can just copy and paste below:

```
# Feedback for Selena Gomez and Justin Timberlake, CS16 W18

* Mentor: Lily Gaucho

* Feedback on your labs will be encoded using the following legend:

* \+ o - are indications from Moderator's review
  * o is **ok**, met expectations (no deductions),
  * \- **below expectations** (deduction might be made by TA or instructor), 
  * \+ means **exceeds expectations** 
   * In rare cases, instructor or TA might award points to offset other deductions. No guarantee of this.
  * ? is a flag used by moderators to raise a **question** for the TA to investigate further
* Poss: Possible Points
* Pts: Points Awarded (only filled in by TA or Instructor, NOT by moderator)

# lab02 feedback: code review of repo on github

# mid quarter report
```

## Step 2: Clone the student repo for the labs from github

For each individual/student pair, clone their repo for lab01 and lab02 to your local machine or csil 


## Step 3: lab01 feedback: code review of repo on github

In the student feedback repo on github, under the section for lab01 paste the following feedback template which includes a table 

```
## lab01 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions implemented: block.cpp, pi.cpp, min4.cpp|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| FUN  |       | Made appropriate use of function calls in min4.cpp   |
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |

```

You must try to compile student code and look at it in an editor to give feedback on all these items. Look to see if student has reused some functions like min3 and min2, if they haven't suggest improvements in the comment section.

If student code is not available on github, email them to upload it and mention that in the future there will be point deductions. 

## Step 4: lab02 feedback: code review of repo on github

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo

```
## lab02 feedback: initial code review of repo on github

| Item | +o?-  |   Summary | Comments  
|------|-------|-------------|-----------
| GIT  |       | Repo available on github|
| PAT  |       | Partner was added as collaborator|
| ALL  |       | All functions implemented: starL.cpp, starT.cpp, starZ.cpp|
| COM  |       | Code compiles without warnings | 
| FUN  |       | Code is structured into appropriate functions   |
| STY  |       | coding style good  |
| INS  |       | followed instructions   |


* For STY: code is readable, well indented, good choice of variable names

```
Include any other general feedback or comments


## Step 5: Mid quarter report

Paste the following at the end of the feedback repo. 
Identify areas that are going well and areas that need improvement, offer suggestions

```
## Feedback on overall performance

Your attendence and engagement in lab sections (has been great)/(needs improvement)/(absent).
I think you and your partner are (working great)/(need help with pair programming)/(are having much trouble communicating)
(Great work pushing your code to github)/(Please push your code to github regularly to receive feedback and credit)
Your performance on the quizzes as been (great)/(satisfactory)/(low). (I am happy to help with clarifying any concepts)

```
